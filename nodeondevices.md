# Getting funding to get Node.js on Android, iOS and WinRT
I have a number of ideas ranging from (packaged apps)[http://www.goland.org/html6packagedapps/] to running Thali on Node.js that require Node.js to be available on Android, iOS and WinRT. My goal is to convince my employer that they want to fund this effort. To do that I need to come in with real customers who would want to use Node.js on these OS's if it was available.
