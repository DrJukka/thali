<p>Welcome to the sample Thali app! To use the wonders of Thali you need to do a few things.</p>
<p>You need to copy your files into the assets folder where you found this file! Please make sure
all of your files use relative paths.</p>
<p>You also need to decide what your launch page will be. By default this code will launch assets/index.html. But
there is nothing magical about that. You can change that if you want to by going to src/main/java/com/msopentech/thali/androidpouchdbsdk/app/MainActivity.java
and change the url in loadUrl.</p>
<p>Where ever you launch from make sure you include the scripts listed above. Without them the Thali funcitonality will
not work.</p>
<p>The default settings for the WebView give security permissions for just about everything under the sun. This is fine
so long as *all* the code you are running is your code that you have total control over. But if you are intended to host any kind of
third party content the current settings are a guaranteed security failure. My own suggestion is that you should treat this SDK like
any other program that you would write. It needs to be your code that you own and nothing else.</p>
<p>Believe it or not for the most part stuff should 'just work'. If you hand PouchDB a httpkey URL then it will just
do the right thing. The only real difference between Thali and any other CouchDB application is that you need to
provision. Right now we have some temporary provisioning APIs because we haven't put in the full provisioning framework yet
and we just want to bootstrap things. Those two apis are ThaliXMLHttpRequest.ProvisionClientToHub and
ThaliXMLHttpRequest.ProvisioninHubToHub.</p>
