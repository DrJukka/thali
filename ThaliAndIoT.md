# Thali and the Internet of Things

# Introduction
Thali is about building a peer to peer web, so what does that have to do with the Internet of Things (IoT)? The answer turns out to be 'a lot'. And it's thanks to this that we have found a great way to fund our work on Thali.

The point of intersection is that it turns out that in many IoT scenarios (see, for example, [here](nodeondevices)) we need offline capability. That is, the IoT devices need to keep operating even when they might not have a connection to the Internet with a capital I. Lights can't stop working, machines can't keep machining, etc. if suddenly their Internet connection goes down. They need to keep operating.

This has brought up a bunch of problems that it turns out Thali already has solutions to. So the obvious approach is to leverage Thali's solutions into a series of libraries that we can build for IoT customers. Because we can find actual companies who need these IoT capabilities we can actually get paid to do this work and still open source everything and use it to build the ultimate Thali vision. A great win/win.
