title: Improving the Wifi-direct applications logic
---
With the [Initial Investigation with Wifi-Direct](http://www.drjukka.com/blog/wordpress/?p=24) article we implemented nice logic for our Wifi Direct test application.

It needed some workarounds to get the Wifi-Direct service working nicely with it. With some testing and investigations we found out that we can get the app working with less problems with the service, by doing some simple design chnages.

Check the [blog article](http://www.drjukka.com/blog/wordpress/?p=41) for details.
